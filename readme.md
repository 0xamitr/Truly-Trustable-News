# The Third Front

## Introduction
The Third Front is a simple web app to present the audience with harmless humorous 
satire news posts.
Mainstream media is too concerned with fear mongering, not caring enough about the key issues
so we decided to 'present the truth under the veil of satire'.
Our Goal-
Presenting the community with dose of humurous jokes and making news less scary and less morbid for 
the average John Doe.
